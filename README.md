# Story Format Archive (SFA)

This project contains two parts:

* SFA-Get, a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) tool for downloading story formats found in the `main` branch.
* Flat-file database of JSON files describing story formats for Twine beginning with 2015 (Twine 1.4.2) found in the `docs` branch.

## `npx sfa-get`

SFA-Get can be invoked using `npx sfa-get`.

### Interactive Mode

Without any additional command-line arguments, SFA-Get will run interactive mode:

```bash
npx sfa-get
```

This will then retrieve the JSON index and build a new database:

```bash
üåê Fetching latest JSON database...
‚úÖ Database fetched.
‚úî Select installation
```

The installation option is either `latest` or `specific`.

Choosing `latest` will download the highest versions found of each official story format found in the database. For example, the following output might be produced based on the versions found:

```bash
‚úî Select installation latest
    Downloaded LICENSE to ./story-formats/chapbook/2.3.0/LICENSE
    Downloaded format.js to ./story-formats/chapbook/2.3.0/format.js
    Downloaded logo.svg to ./story-formats/chapbook/2.3.0/logo.svg
    Downloaded LICENSE to ./story-formats/harlowe/3.3.9/LICENSE
    Downloaded format.js to ./story-formats/harlowe/3.3.9/format.js
    Downloaded icon.svg to ./story-formats/harlowe/3.3.9/icon.svg
    Downloaded LICENSE to ./story-formats/paperthin/1.0.0/LICENSE
    Downloaded format.js to ./story-formats/paperthin/1.0.0/format.js
    Downloaded icon.svg to ./story-formats/paperthin/1.0.0/icon.svg
    Downloaded LICENSE to ./story-formats/snowman/2.0.2/LICENSE
    Downloaded format.js to ./story-formats/snowman/2.0.2/format.js
    Downloaded icon.svg to ./story-formats/snowman/2.0.2/icon.svg
    Downloaded LICENSE to ./story-formats/sugarcube/2.37.3/LICENSE
    Downloaded format.js to ./story-formats/sugarcube/2.37.3/format.js
    Downloaded icon.svg to ./story-formats/sugarcube/2.37.3/icon.svg
```

Alternatively, if choosing `specific`, it will ask for the story format name in lowercase and the version number.

```bash
‚úî Select installation specific
‚úî Enter story format name:
‚úî Enter version: 
```

### Specific Mode

Specific story formats can also be accessed by name and version. For example, to retrieve only Harlowe 3.3.9, it would be the following:

```bash
npx sfa-get harlowe 3.3.9
```

The previous command would create only the directory `./story-formats/harlowe/3.3.9/` with the following files based on the [GitHub directory of the same name and version](https://github.com/videlais/story-formats-archive/tree/docs/official/twine2/harlowe/3.3.9):

* `LICENSE`
* `format.js`
* `icon.svg`

### SFA: Web Search

[A simple search](https://videlais.github.io/story-formats-archive/) is provided to help verify entries and general data in the database.

## Archive Database

* Official: `https://videlais.github.io/story-formats-archive/official/index.json`
* Unofficial: `https://videlais.github.io/story-formats-archive/unofficial/index.json`

### Organization

Organization is split between `official` and `unofficial`. If a story format currently is or was packaged with Twine at any point in time, it is considered "official" with all others falling into the "unofficial" collection. Generally, those in the "unofficial" collection are more experimental in nature with some providing complex functionality and others, for example, the ability to export Twine data in different file formats.

Story formats are additionally sorted into `twine1` and `twine2` sub-collections. In some cases, a story format might be in both categories if it was originally published during the transitory period between major versions.

### Organization Example

URL: `/official/index.json`

```json
{
    "twine1": [
        {

        }
    ],
    "twine2":[
        {

        }
    ]
}
```

Directories within the major Twine versions include story format and minor version per story format (e.g. `harlowe/3.3.0`). For Twine 1 story formats, the version of Twine (e.g. `1.4.2`) is used unless explicitly mentioned by the build or author.

### Directory Example

URL: `/official/twine2/chapbook/1.0.0/`

### Story Format Properties

#### Official

Each official story format has the following properties:

            "files": [
            ]

```

### Twine 2

Each story format folder contains:

* `format.js`: JSONP code. (See [Twine 2 Story Format output specification](https://github.com/iftechfoundation/twine-specs/blob/master/twine-2-storyformats-spec.md).)
* `icon.svg`: Icon.
* `LICENSE`: License text.

### Twine 1

Depending on the story format, there may be up to three files:

* `header.html`: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
* `LICENSE`: License text.
* `code.js`: Additional JavaScript code.

In cases where the `code.js` file is not included, the complete JavaScript of the story format can be assumed to be part of the `header.html` file.
